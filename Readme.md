Basically this was a small challenge that I took to try to build a smaller version of an enterprise level Load Balancer, for example- NGINX, which is a third-party load balancer to optimize the website URLs you have by smartly using a simple process like reverse proxying to complex implications like dividing users over different API URLs to equally distribute traffic and manage load efficiently.
I tried using some different load-balancing techniques to solve this problem like the round-robin method, least connections method, etc so see how effectively does those work in my case.

Here are some more details about the same :

##Approach to Design and Functionality
In tackling Milestone 1 of the project, my primary goal was to create a load balancer that not only distributed traffic efficiently but also adapted dynamically to varying conditions. Here are key elements of my approach:

##Dynamic Routing Logic: I implemented a versatile routing mechanism that goes beyond simple load balancing. By considering factors such as API type (REST, GraphQL, gRPC), request payload size and type, and randomized routing strategies, I ensured that the load balancer intelligently directs requests to optimize performance based on real-time conditions.

##Simulation of API Behaviors: To mimic real-world scenarios, I developed mock API endpoints with diverse response times and behaviors. This included functions to simulate both slow and fast responses, allowing for comprehensive testing of the load balancer's resilience under different conditions.

##Logging and Metrics: Robust logging mechanisms were incorporated to capture detailed metrics such as request times, endpoint selection criteria, and response times. This not only facilitated real-time monitoring but also provided invaluable insights for performance optimization and troubleshooting.

##Innovations in Queue Management and Analysis
For Milestone 2, I extended the load balancer to include advanced queue management strategies. Hereâ€™s how I demonstrated creativity in this phase:

##Diverse Queue Implementations: I implemented various queue types including FIFO, priority-based, and round-robin strategies. Each queue type was meticulously designed to handle requests based on specific criteria, showcasing my ability to tailor solutions to diverse workload scenarios.

##Performance Analysis: Detailed logs and metrics were generated for each queuing strategy, enabling thorough performance analysis. By systematically evaluating how different strategies impacted load distribution and overall system performance, I provided actionable insights to optimize operational efficiency.


##Detailed Documentation: I provided thorough documentation outlining my design decisions, setup instructions, and usage guidelines. This documentation not only serves as a reference for future enhancements but also highlights my commitment to transparency and thoroughness.


##Conclusion
I am excited about the prospect of contributing to innovative projects. My approach to the Intelligent Load Balancer project reflects my dedication to excellence, creativity in problem-solving, and a proactive mindset toward continuous improvement.
